### Contribute to the Sugar Gallery

Sensing Sugar welcomes contributions to the Sugar Gallery. This is where you can share the music and visuals produced by your blood sugar data with other visitors to the website. If you would like to do so, please get in touch at [sensingsugar@gmail.com](mailto:sensingsugar@gmail.com).

When your blood sugar is included in the Sugar Gallery, other visitors to the website will be able to experience the music and visuals it produces. Items included in the Sugar Gallery can be named in any way you wish. Some information you might want to include: the date/time range of the blood sugar readings, the type of readings (CGM or BGM), and your name. But you can also choose to name your file completely differently and remain anonymous. Let us know what you prefer in your e-mail message.

In order to include your blood sugar in the gallery, you will need to send your data to the e-mail address above as a CSV, JSON, or spreadsheet file (see the [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VE5JmlrB2MPTYNuiO1rN6_idoGAQMh44Cqja982c6d8/edit?usp=sharing) for how to create a CSV file). Before sending the file, we recommend that you remove all data except the glucose values and the date/time they were taken. We will remove all unnecessary data before including the music and visuals produced by your blood sugar data in the gallery.

**Disclaimer**: Sensing Sugar is a small artist-run project. We cannot guarantee the privacy of data contained in the Sugar Gallery. Please do not share any data that you would not feel comfortable sharing publicly.
