#### How it works

Glucose values alone determine pitches, timbres, rhythms, tempo, timing, colours, textures, and patterns. All other data is discarded.

Generally, datasets with more changes in the glucose values produce more dynamic results.

Smaller datasets (from 5 - 300 glucose values) tend to produce more interesting results than larger datasets. Each blood sugar reading in a dataset plays for a number of seconds equal to its value in mmol/L (ex. 120 mg/dl = 6.7mmol/L = 6.7 seconds). That means that 288 readings (one day of CGM readings taken every 5 minutes) with an average or 8.0mmol/L takes about 35-40min to play from start to finish. Given that far fewer readings are taken with a BGM than a CGM, a day of readings from a BGM will take much less time to play back than a day of readings from a CGM.

For practical reasons, datasets of more than 1000 readings will currently only play the first 1000 readings. 1000 readings will take anywhere from 1h to 5.5h to play in full depending on the values contained.
