### How to structure your file

You can submit data as a CSV or JSON file from a blood glucose monitor (BGM), a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), or manually recorded results. The values of the blood sugar can be in either mmol/L or mg/dl.  

The CSV file must contain at least one column named **glucose**, and must have the file extension **'.csv'**.

The JSON file should be an array of objects containing the property **glucose**, and must have the file extension **'.json'**. 

See the [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VE5JmlrB2MPTYNuiO1rN6_idoGAQMh44Cqja982c6d8/edit?usp=sharing) for how to create a CSV file.
