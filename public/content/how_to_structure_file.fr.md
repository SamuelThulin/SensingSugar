### How to structure your file

You can submit data as a CSV or JSON file from a blood glucose monitor (BGM), a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), or manually recorded results. The values of the blood sugar can be in either mmol/L or mg/dl.  

The CSV file must contain at least one column named `glucose`.

The JSON file should be an array of objects containing the property `glucose`.

See the [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jB-FDJTeDryi3EqsKoduaYKC28WoE8MpHQro7-ltAkI/edit#heading=h.70v24mh7ugj) for how to create a CSV file.
