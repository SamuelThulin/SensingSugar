Sensing Sugar produces music and visuals from blood sugar data. It is not intended to be a scientific representation of the data, but a creative space for relating to data differently. I developed Sensing Sugar as an artist and diabetic who is curious about understanding chronic illness in new ways.

If you track your blood sugar, Sensing Sugar allows you to see and hear your data.
Click **“Try With Your Sugar”** below. Your data will remain private and never leaves your computer.

If you would like to see and hear the results from people who have volunteered to have their blood sugar music and visuals included in the website’s Sugar Gallery, click “Experience Someone Else’s Sugar”. From there, you can also volunteer to include your blood sugar music and visuals in the gallery.
